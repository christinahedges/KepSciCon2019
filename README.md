# KepSciCon2019

This repo contains my slides for [Kepler/K2 Science Conference V](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/scicon-2019/) where I tried to answer the question "Are there any planets left in Kepler/K2 data". My slides are in the pdf, and there is a deep dive notebook showing each hidden planet candidate in each of the following systems:

* K2-43
* K2-198
* K2-168

These planet candidates have gone unreported for several reasons, which I detail in each notebook.
