    "In my talk at [KeplerK2SciCon](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/scicon-2019/) I discussed whether there are any planets hiding in the Kepler/K2 dataset that have yet to be discovered. As highlighted in the RNAAS by [Dotson et al 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ab01c6), based only on the Kepler prime planet occurrence rates, there are many planets still waiting to be found in K2. The figure from that work is below:"

    "However, these ideas and figures can not really show you that planets are still waiting to be found in the Kepler/K2 data set. In order to show some key examples, in this set of notebooks I highlight **three unreported planet candidates** in the existing K2 exoplanet catalogue. These candidates have been hiding due to three key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different motion detrending methods have various strengths and weaknesses, and so searching for planets in light curve detrended with **multiple techniques** can yield new candidates\n",
    "* K2 is particularly impacted by young and variable stars, and so careful removal of **long term stellar activity** is important to find new planets.\n",
    "* Planets in multiple systems are often found to be in near resonances, and multiple planet signals can overlap in BLS periodograms. Searching carefully for additional planets **close to harmonics** in a BLS periodogram can yield more planets."
